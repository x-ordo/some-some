# Claude.md - AI Development Context Guide

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** 썸썸 (Thumb Some) 👆💕👆
**Tagline:** "게임인 척하며 자연스럽게 손 잡기"
**Type:** Flutter-based Hyper-Casual Social Interactive App
**Target Users:** 20-30대 남녀 (썸 초기 단계, 소개팅/술자리)

### Core Concept
A mobile game that **forces physical contact as a game mechanic**. Two users must touch and hold moving characters on a shared smartphone screen for 15 seconds, creating natural skinship through gameplay.

---

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed (MVP)
- **Single-file architecture** (`main.dart`) - intentionally monolithic for rapid prototyping
- **쫀드기 챌린지 (Sticky Fingers)** core game logic
- **Toss Design System (TDS)** implementation with kitsch accents
- **CustomPainter** for 60fps+ graphics rendering
- **Haptic feedback** system (light/medium/heavy impacts)
- **FadeInUp** animations with spring curves
- **Multi-touch** detection and tracking

### ⏳ Planned Features (Not Implemented)
- **Mode B:** 이심전심 텔레파시 (Soul Sync) - compatibility quiz with split-screen
- **Mode C:** 복불복 룰렛 (Penalty) - customizable penalty roulette
- **Firebase integration** for remote question lists
- **Result sharing** (Instagram story-style receipts)
- **In-App Purchase** for additional content packs

---

## Architecture Principles

### 1. File Structure Philosophy
**Current:** Single-file MVP (`main.dart`)
**Future:** When complexity grows, split into:
```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── core/
│   ├── design_system/
│   │   └── tds.dart
│   └── utils/
├── features/
│   ├── intro/
│   ├── sticky_fingers/
│   ├── soul_sync/
│   └── penalty_roulette/
└── shared/
    └── widgets/
```

**⚠️ Rule:** Only refactor into modules **when adding Mode B or C**. Keep current simplicity for now.

### 2. Design System (TDS)

**Base:** Toss Design System philosophy
- **Colors:**
  - `background: #17171C` (Dark mode base)
  - `primaryBlue: #0064FF` (Toss brand color)
  - `kitschPink: #FF007F` (Accent for game vibe)
  - `kitschYellow: #FFD700` (Secondary accent)

- **Typography:** `-0.5` letter spacing for readability
- **Motion:** `Curves.elasticOut` for "쫀득한" (chewy) feel
- **Components:** Rounded corners (16px), clear hierarchy

**⚠️ Rule:** Never deviate from TDS color palette. New colors require explicit approval.

### 3. Game Logic - Sticky Fingers Algorithm

**Target Movement (8-figure path):**
```dart
// Sin/Cos combination creates crossing paths
targetA = Offset(
  centerX - 80 + sin(_time * 1.5) * 60 * intensity,
  centerY + cos(_time * 2.1) * 100 * intensity,
);

targetB = Offset(
  centerX + 80 + cos(_time * 1.8) * 60 * intensity,  // Opposite phase
  centerY + sin(_time * 2.4) * 100 * intensity,
);
```

**Physics Parameters:**
- `gameDuration: 15.0` seconds
- `targetRadius: 45.0` (visual circle)
- `touchTolerance: 60.0` (hit detection)
- `intensity: 1.0 + (progress * 2.0)` (difficulty scaling)

**⚠️ Rule:** Don't change physics constants without playtesting. Current values are carefully balanced.

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Critical Requirements:**
- Maintain **60fps minimum** (120fps preferred on ProMotion displays)
- Use `Ticker` directly, not `AnimationController` for game loop
- `CustomPainter.shouldRepaint` always returns `true` (intentional - game state changes every frame)

**⚠️ Rule:** Profile performance before/after ANY game loop changes.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. **Dart Formatting:**
   - Use `dart format` before commits
   - Line length: 120 characters (not 80)
   - Prefer expression bodies for single-line getters

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Private variables: `_camelCase`
   - Constants: `camelCase` (not SCREAMING_SNAKE)
   - Widget classes: `PascalCase`

3. **Comments:**
   - Korean OK for domain-specific terms (e.g., `// 쫀드기 로직`)
   - English for generic programming concepts
   - Use section dividers like `// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------`

### Testing Strategy

**Current:** Manual testing only (acceptable for MVP)
**Future:** When adding new modes:
- Unit tests for game logic (collision detection, timer)
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for full game flow

**⚠️ Rule:** Don't write tests for current MVP unless bugs appear in production.

### Git Workflow

1. **Branch naming:** `claude/feature-name-{sessionId}`
2. **Commit style:**
   ```
   feat: add soul sync mode basic UI
   fix: prevent game start with single touch
   refactor: extract game logic from widget
   ```
3. **Always commit working code** (playable state)

## Common Tasks & Solutions

### Adding a New Game Mode

1. Create new screen widget (e.g., `SoulSyncScreen`)
2. Add navigation button in `IntroScreen`
3. Design game logic with similar structure to `GameScreen`:
   - State management
   - Touch handling
   - Game loop (if needed)
   - Result overlay
4. Reuse `TossButton`, `FadeInUp`, TDS constants

### Tweaking Game Difficulty

**Easier:**
- Increase `touchTolerance` (60 → 80)
- Decrease `intensity` multiplier (2.0 → 1.5)
- Reduce movement speed (multiply frequency values by 0.8)

**Harder:**
- Add sudden direction changes
- Increase `gameDuration` (15 → 20 seconds)
- Make targets smaller (`targetRadius: 45 → 35`)

### Adding Haptic Patterns

Available methods:
- `HapticFeedback.lightImpact()` - subtle (e.g., heartbeat)
- `HapticFeedback.mediumImpact()` - standard (e.g., button tap)
- `HapticFeedback.heavyImpact()` - strong (e.g., game start/fail)
- `HapticFeedback.vibrate()` - celebration (success state)

**⚠️ Rule:** Test on physical device. Haptics don't work in simulator.

### Handling Screen Sizes

**Current approach:** Relative positioning via `MediaQuery.of(context).size`
**Safe area:** Already handled with `SafeArea` widget in `IntroScreen`
**Notch handling:** Implicit via Flutter's safe area

**⚠️ Rule:** Test on both small (iPhone SE) and large (iPad) screens before release.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Bugs
None reported (MVP just completed)

### Technical Debt
1. **Hard-coded initial positions:** `targetA = Offset(100, 400)` should use screen dimensions
2. **No state persistence:** Exiting game loses progress (acceptable for MVP)
3. **Single-threaded physics:** Game loop blocks UI thread (acceptable at 60fps)

### Platform-Specific Issues
- **iOS:** Requires `Info.plist` permission for haptics (already added)
- **Android:** May need `VIBRATE` permission check (TODO)

---

## Communication Style & UX Copy

### Voice & Tone
- **Casual Korean slang:** "띠로리~", "천생연분!", "어머! 닿겠어!"
- **B-grade sensibility:** Intentionally cheesy/kitsch
- **No formality:** Never use 존댓말 (polite form)

### Example Copy Patterns
```
✅ Good: "이 정도면 사귀어야 하는 거 아님?"
❌ Bad: "축하드립니다. 게임을 완료하셨습니다."

✅ Good: "손을 놓쳐버렸어요!"
❌ Bad: "터치가 감지되지 않았습니다."
```

**⚠️ Rule:** Keep the playful, slightly cringey vibe. This is a feature, not a bug.

---

## Dependencies & Environment

### Current `pubspec.yaml`
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  # No external packages yet (intentional)

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^4.0.0
```

**⚠️ Rule:** Only add dependencies when **absolutely necessary**. Prefer built-in Flutter APIs.

### Planned Additions
- `riverpod: ^2.x` - State management (when adding Mode B/C)
- `firebase_core` - Backend integration
- `share_plus` - Social sharing
- `in_app_purchase` - Monetization

## AI Development Guidelines (For Claude)

### When Working on This Project:

1. **Read first, code second:** Always check existing implementation before suggesting changes
2. **Respect the vibe:** Maintain the playful, B-grade aesthetic
3. **Test on device:** Remind user to test haptics/multi-touch on physical hardware
4. **Ask before refactoring:** Don't break up `main.dart` unless user requests it
5. **Korean OK:** Use Korean in comments for domain terms, English for technical concepts
6. **Performance matters:** 60fps is non-negotiable for game feel

### When User Requests Are Ambiguous:

1. **Default to simplicity:** Don't over-engineer
2. **Match existing patterns:** Use TossButton, FadeInUp, TDS colors
3. **Preserve game feel:** Don't change physics without explicit ask

### When Adding New Features:

1. Confirm requirements first
2. Show code diff for critical sections (game loop, physics)
3. Warn about performance implications if adding heavy operations
4. Suggest testing checklist
